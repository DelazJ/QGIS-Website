# Contributor Requirements

## Requirements for new contributors

We welcome new contributors to our community - we want you to use QGIS as a platform for doing your work - and we believe that QGIS is a great platform for that. In order to contribute code, patches, or documentation to the QGIS project, all developers/team members must:

- Abide by the [Social Contract](#social-contract).

- Be familiar with the development process and the reference material available in the [Developers Guide for QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/index.html), and the [CODING document](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the root of the QGIS Sources.

- Ensure that all code committed to the repository is unencumbered and compatible with the [QGIS license](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/COPYING), GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2 or any later version.

- Not use or include any code that will cause a trademark or patent infringement. If you are unsure, ask on the [developer mailing list]({{< relref "community/organisation/mailinglists/#qgis-developers-list" >}}) or contact a [Project Steering Committee]({{< relref "community/organisation/#project-steering-committee" >}}) member.

- Join the [qgis-developer mailing list]({{< relref "community/organisation/mailinglists/#qgis-developers-list" >}}) and contribute to discussions

- These requirements apply to both developers desiring commit privileges and those that submit patches.

- Read and agree to the [Code of Conduct]({{< relref "conduct" >}}).

- Read and agree to the [Coding Standards](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.html).

- Read and agree to the [Diversity statement]({{< relref "diversity" >}}).

- Agree to these requirements by sending an email to the [qgis-developer mailing list]({{< relref "community/organisation/mailinglists/#qgis-developers-list" >}}) stating agreement.

## Social Contract

QGIS is a collaborative project. As an open source project we hope for and encourage participation and code contributions from interested parties. However in order to maintain high standards we encourage you to participate in the project according to the following social contract:

- To be polite to all members of the project

- To ensure any code you submit via a patch or commit to source control is properly documented

- To ensure any code you submit via a patch or commit to source control is compliant with our CodingStandards

- Not to submit any code without having permission to submit that code

- Not to submit any code that violates the GNU Public License

- To follow the [Contributor Requirements](#contributor-requirements) mentioned above

- To ensure (to the best of your ability) that any commits you make to git leave the repository in a compilable state

- To ensure that any new class added to the source is accompanied by a test unit

- To carry out appropriate tests before committing new code to the repository

- To smile, laugh and crack a joke once in a while - we are all here to have fun!
